# Electric Vehicle Population Analysis in Washington State

## Project Description
This project aims to analyze the geographic distribution, and market penetration related to electric vehicles (EVs) in Washington state. By examining data on EV adoption across various counties and cities, the project provides insights that can guide policy decisions, marketing strategies, and support programs for electric vehicles.

## Business Objectives and Goals

### 1. Geographic Distribution Analysis
- **Objective:** Identify which counties and cities in Washington state have the highest and lowest numbers of electric vehicles (EVs).
- **Goal:** Understand regional adoption trends and identify areas that may benefit from additional support or incentives to encourage higher adoption of EVs.
- **Steps to Achieve the Goal:**
  1. Count and compare the number of EVs across different counties and cities.
  2. Visualize the distribution using bar charts and maps.
  3. Analyze the results to suggest where additional incentives or support might be needed.

### 2. Market Penetration and Growth Trends
- **Objective:** Analyze how the number of electric vehicles has changed over time across different counties and cities.
- **Goal:** Understand the growth trend of EV adoption and project future adoption rates to help stakeholders plan accordingly.
- **Steps to Achieve the Goal:**
  1. Group the data by year (based on Model Year) and count the number of EVs for each year.
  2. Visualize the growth trend using line charts.
  3. Compare growth trends across different regions to identify areas with rapid or slow adoption.
