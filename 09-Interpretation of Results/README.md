## 1. Executive Summary

### Objective
The project aimed to analyze electric vehicle (EV) adoption across Washington State, focusing on geographic distribution, market penetration, and consumer behavior. The goal was to provide actionable insights that could guide policy decisions, marketing strategies, and support programs to enhance EV adoption.

### Key Findings
- **Geographic Distribution:** King County dominates EV adoption, followed by other urban areas like Snohomish and Pierce counties. Rural counties show significantly lower adoption rates.
- **Market Penetration:** EV adoption has increased sharply in urban areas, with Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) becoming more popular than Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs).

### Recommendations
- **Infrastructure Investment:** Expand EV charging infrastructure, particularly in rural areas, to encourage broader adoption.
- **Targeted Incentives:** Introduce incentives in low-adoption regions to stimulate interest in EVs.
- **Promote BEVs:** Focus marketing and infrastructure efforts on supporting the continued growth of BEVs.

## 2. Detailed Report

### Introduction
This report provides a detailed analysis of EV adoption in Washington State, focusing on understanding regional adoption trends, growth over time, and consumer preferences. The analysis aims to inform decisions related to EV infrastructure development, policy-making, and marketing strategies.

### Data Overview
- **Dataset:** The data used in this analysis includes various features such as county, city, model year, EV type, CAFV eligibility, and other relevant factors.
- **Preprocessing:** The data was cleaned to handle missing values, outliers were removed, and relevant features were engineered to better align with the business objectives.

### Methodology
- **Geographic Distribution:** Analyzed the distribution of EVs across counties and cities using bar charts and maps.
- **Market Penetration:** Used time series analysis to study EV adoption trends over time.


### Results
- **Geographic Distribution:** King County leads EV adoption, with significant disparities between urban and rural areas.
- **Market Penetration:** Rapid growth in EV adoption was observed in urban areas, with BEVs becoming more dominant over time.


### Recommendations
- **Expand Infrastructure:** Focus on building more charging stations in rural areas to support EV adoption.
- **Incentives for Rural Areas:** Implement targeted incentives in low-adoption regions.
- **Support BEV Growth:** Prioritize BEV infrastructure and marketing efforts, particularly in regions with high adoption rates.

### Conclusion
The analysis provides clear insights into where and how EV adoption is happening in Washington State, along with actionable recommendations to support further growth. Continued monitoring and targeted investments are key to ensuring the success of EV adoption initiatives.
