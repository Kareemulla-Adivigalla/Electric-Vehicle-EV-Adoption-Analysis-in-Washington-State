# EV Adoption in Washington State - Dashboard Analysis

## üìä Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) across Washington State using a Power BI dashboard. The analysis delves into geographic distribution, market penetration, and consumer behavior, providing actionable insights to support policy decisions, marketing strategies, and infrastructure development.

## üéØ Objectives
The primary objectives of this analysis were:
1. **Geographic Distribution Analysis**: 
   - To identify regions with the highest and lowest EV adoption rates.
   - Goal: Support targeted efforts to improve EV adoption in underrepresented areas.
   
2. **Market Penetration and Growth Trends**: 
   - To understand the growth trend of EV adoption over time, specifically focusing on Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) vs. Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs).
   - Goal: Project future trends to aid stakeholders in planning infrastructure and policy.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies
- **Power BI**: Used for data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: For calculating KPIs and performing advanced data manipulation within Power BI.
- **Python**: Used for initial data cleaning and preprocessing.
- **Microsoft Excel**: Utilized for data inspection and simple transformations.

## üöÄ Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The following KPIs were crucial for analyzing the EV adoption:
- **Total EVs by County**
- **Total EVs by City**
- **Proportion of BEVs vs. PHEVs**
- **Year-over-Year Growth Rate**
- **Top EV Manufacturers**

## üîç Key Findings
1. **Dominance of Urban Areas**: King County leads in EV adoption with 103K vehicles, highlighting a trend where urban areas show significantly higher adoption rates than rural areas.
2. **Rapid Growth in EV Adoption**: EV adoption, particularly BEVs, has surged in recent years, with notable increases starting around 2015.
3. **Strong Preference for BEVs**: BEVs are more popular than PHEVs, making up 78.46% of total EVs.
4. **Tesla‚Äôs Market Leadership**: Tesla is the top manufacturer in the state, with 88K vehicles, reflecting its strong influence on the EV market.

## üí° Actionable Recommendations
1. **Enhance Infrastructure in Rural Areas**: To address the disparity in adoption rates, it‚Äôs recommended to expand EV charging infrastructure in rural regions.
2. **Implement Targeted Incentives**: Offering incentives in low-adoption areas could stimulate interest and increase EV registrations.
3. **Focus on BEV Support**: Given the clear preference for BEVs, efforts should be made to ensure that infrastructure and policies support their continued growth.
4. **Leverage Tesla‚Äôs Influence**: Collaborating with Tesla could further drive adoption, as they are the leading brand in the state.

## üìÑ How to Navigate the Dashboard
1. **Access**: Open the Power BI dashboard and navigate between pages using the tabs.
2. **Interactivity**: The dashboard is fully interactive, allowing you to filter by county, city, EV type, and more.
3. **Insights**: Hover over visual elements to get detailed insights and numerical values.
4. **Data Source**: The dataset is derived from Washington State's EV registration records, ensuring accurate and up-to-date information.

## üìú Conclusion
This analysis has successfully met the outlined objectives, providing a detailed understanding of EV adoption patterns across Washington State. The dashboard serves as a valuable tool for stakeholders aiming to make data-driven decisions regarding EV policies and market strategies.
